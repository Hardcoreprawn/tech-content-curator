## Editorial Policy

We prioritize accuracy, transparency, and usefulness over volume.

We **do**:
- Attribute original sources clearly
- Link to primary and supporting sources
- Explain limitations when evidence is thin
- Write for broad accessibility (approx. ages 13–15)

We **do not**:
- Invent citations or quotes
- Present unverifiable personal claims
- Publish content without usable source URLs

## Sourcing Methodology

1) **Primary source**
   - Every article begins with a primary source URL from a trusted feed.

2) **Supporting sources**
   - We collect additional URLs to ground claims and add context.
   - If no supporting sources are available, the item is rejected.

3) **Evidence handling**
   - We include short quotes or snippets when the source provides them.
   - If the source does not include quotable text, we state that explicitly.

4) **Attribution and references**
   - We include a References section with URLs only.
   - If we can’t provide URL-based references, we do not publish.

## Quality Gate

We apply filters before generation to avoid publishing weak or ungrounded content:

- Minimum quality score threshold
- Required supporting URLs
- Deduplication against previously published sources

This keeps output consistent and defensible.
