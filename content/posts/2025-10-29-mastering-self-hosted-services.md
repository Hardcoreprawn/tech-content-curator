## Getting Started

### Minimal Viable Setup

To get started with self-hosting, you can use Docker and Docker Compose. Below is a simple `docker-compose.yml` example to set up a basic reverse proxy with Traefik and a sample web application.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  reverse-proxy:
    image: traefik:v2.5
    command:
      - "--api.insecure=true"
      - "--providers.docker=true"
      - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "8080:8080" # Traefik dashboard
    volumes:
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"

  app:
    image: nginx:alpine
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.app.rule=Host(`app.local`)"
      - "traefik.http.services.app.loadbalancer.server.port=80"
    networks:
      - web

networks:
  web:
    external: true
```
