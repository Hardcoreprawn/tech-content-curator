## Categories of Open Source Graphics Applications

### 1. Raster Graphics Manipulation
**Tools: GIMP, Krita, Darktable**

Raster graphics are composed of pixels, making them ideal for photo editing and detailed image manipulation.

- **[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org)**: GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is a robust tool for raster graphics editing. It excels in photo retouching, image composition, and image authoring. Key features include customizable brushes, layers, and advanced filters. However, its interface can be overwhelming for beginners. GIMP is perfect for users who require a comprehensive tool for complex image editing tasks.

- **[Krita](https://krita.org)**: Originally designed for digital painting, Krita offers a rich set of features for artists, including brush stabilizers, a pop-up palette, and a powerful layer management system. Its user-friendly interface and extensive brush engine make it a favorite among illustrators. If you're focused on painting rather than photo editing, Krita is the ideal choice.

- **[Darktable](https://www.darktable.org)**: Darktable is a photography workflow application and raw developer. It allows photographers to manage digital negatives in a database and enables non-destructive editing. Its powerful features include tethering, advanced color management, and a user-friendly interface tailored for photographers. Choose Darktable for a dedicated photo editing experience, especially if you work with RAW files.

### 2. Vector Graphics
**Tools: Inkscape, Synfig, QCAD/CAM**

Vector graphics are based on mathematical expressions, making them scalable without loss of quality, ideal for logos and illustrations.

- **[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org)**: Inkscape is a versatile vector graphics editor that supports SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format. It features a wide range of tools for creating and editing shapes, paths, and text. While it may not have the same level of polish as some commercial counterparts, its extensive feature set makes it a powerful choice for graphic designers and illustrators.

```

## Practical Evaluation Criteria

When choosing the right open source graphics application, consider the following criteria:
- **Functionality**: Does the tool meet your specific needs (e.g., photo editing, animation)?
- **Usability**: Is the interface user-friendly, especially for beginners?
- **Community Support**: Is there a strong user community and documentation available?
- **Compatibility**: Does the tool support the file formats you need?
- **Performance**: How well does the tool perform on your hardware?

## Getting Started

To get started with these tools, consider using Docker to run applications in isolated environments. Below is a simple example using Docker Compose for a graphics stack that includes GIMP, Inkscape, and Kdenlive.

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  gimp:
    image: gimp/gimp
    volumes:
      - ./gimp_data:/data
    ports:
      - "8080:80"

  inkscape:
    image: inkscape/inkscape
    volumes:
      - ./inkscape_data:/data
    ports:
      - "8081:80"

  kdenlive:
    image: kdenlive/kdenlive
    volumes:
      - ./kdenlive_data:/data
    ports:
      - "8082:80"
```

This configuration sets up three containers for GIMP, Inkscape, and Kdenlive, allowing you to work with each application while preserving your project files in designated volumes.
