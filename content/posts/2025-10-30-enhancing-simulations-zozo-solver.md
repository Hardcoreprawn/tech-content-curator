## Understanding Physics-Based Simulations

Physics-based simulations are computer-generated models designed to replicate real-world physical phenomena. These simulations rely on mathematical algorithms to predict how objects interact under varying conditions, which is vital for applications across multiple industries.

### Key Concepts
1. **Rigid Body Dynamics**: This area of physics focuses on the motion of solid objects that do not deform under stress. Rigid body dynamics is crucial in creating realistic movements and interactions between objects in a simulation.

2. **Collision Detection**: This process involves determining when two or more objects collide within a simulation. Effective collision detection is essential for ensuring that objects interact realistically, whether it’s a ball bouncing off a wall or a character colliding with an obstacle.

3. **Response Algorithms**: Once a collision is detected, response algorithms compute the outcomes of that interaction, such as changes in velocity or direction. These algorithms are fundamental to providing a believable simulation experience.

> **Background**: Physics-based simulations are widely used in industries ranging from video games to aerospace engineering to model the behavior of objects in a controlled environment.

## The Role of Contact Solvers

At the heart of physics-based simulations lies the contact solver, a critical component responsible for managing the interactions between objects. Contact solvers ensure that simulated objects respond realistically to forces and collisions, making them indispensable for creating immersive experiences.
