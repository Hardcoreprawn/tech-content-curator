## Getting Started

To get started with these applications, consider the following Docker Compose snippet for setting up a local development environment:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  gimp:
    image: gimp/gimp
    volumes:
      - ./gimp_data:/data
    command: gimp

  krita:
    image: krita/critical
    volumes:
      - ./krita_data:/data
    command: krita

  blender:
    image: blender/blender
    volumes:
      - ./blender_data:/data
    command: blender
```

This snippet sets up containers for GIMP, Krita, and Blender, allowing you to start working with these tools quickly. Adjust the volume paths as needed for your project files.
