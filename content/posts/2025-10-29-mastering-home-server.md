# Comprehensive Guide to Running Self-Hosted Services at Home

In an era where data privacy and control are paramount, running self-hosted services at home offers a viable solution for individuals and small teams. This guide will provide you with a reference architecture, compare various tools, and lay out a growth path for your home server ecosystem.

## Key Takeaways
- Self-hosting gives you control over your data and services.
- A reverse proxy is essential for managing traffic and SSL termination.
- Container orchestration simplifies deployment and management of applications.
- Monitoring and backups are critical for data integrity and availability.
- Scaling from a minimal setup to a robust infrastructure is straightforward with the right tools.

## Reference Architecture

Below is a simplified ASCII diagram representing the architecture of a self-hosted environment:

## Getting Started

### Minimal Viable Setup

For a basic self-hosted environment, you can use Docker and Docker Compose. Below is an example `docker-compose.yml` file to get you started with a reverse proxy (Traefik) and a sample application (Jellyfin).

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  reverse-proxy:
    image: traefik:v2.5
    command:
      - "--api.insecure=true"
      - "--providers.docker=true"
      - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"

  jellyfin:
    image: jellyfin/jellyfin
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.jellyfin.rule=Host(`jellyfin.local`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.jellyfin.entrypoints=web"
    volumes:
      - jellyfin_data:/data

volumes:
  jellyfin_data:
```
