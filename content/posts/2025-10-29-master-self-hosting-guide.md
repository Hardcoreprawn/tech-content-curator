# Comprehensive Guide to Running Self-Hosted Services at Home

## Introduction

Self-hosting is a powerful way to take control of your digital life, allowing you to run applications and services from the comfort of your own home. With a variety of free software options available, you can create a tailored environment that meets your needs. This guide will provide a reference architecture for running self-hosted services, compare credible options across various categories, and outline a minimal viable setup with a clear growth path.

### Key Takeaways
- Self-hosting empowers you to manage your services, enhancing privacy and control.
- A reverse proxy is essential for managing traffic and securing your applications.
- Orchestration tools simplify the management of containers but vary in complexity.
- Monitoring and backup solutions are crucial for maintaining service reliability.
- Growth paths allow for scaling from a simple setup to a more complex environment.

## Reference Architecture

Below is an ASCII diagram illustrating a basic architecture for a self-hosted environment:

```

## Getting Started

### Minimal Viable Setup

To get started with a simple self-hosted setup, you can use Docker and Docker Compose to manage your containers. Below is an example `docker-compose.yml` file that sets up a reverse proxy using Traefik and a basic web application.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  reverse-proxy:
    image: traefik:v2.5
    command:
      - "--api.insecure=true"
      - "--providers.docker=true"
      - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"

  app:
    image: nginx:alpine
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.app.rule=Host(`yourdomain.com`)"
      - "traefik.http.services.app.loadbalancer.server.port=80"
```

To deploy this setup, save the above configuration in a file named `docker-compose.yml`, and run the following command in the same directory:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start Traefik and an Nginx server. Make sure to replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name.

## Growth Path

Starting with a minimal setup, you can gradually expand your self-hosted environment by adding more services, integrating additional tools, and scaling your infrastructure. Hereâ€™s a suggested growth path:

1. **Start Small**: Begin with a reverse proxy (like Traefik) and a single application (e.g., Jellyfin).
2. **Add Monitoring**: Implement a monitoring solution (like Prometheus) to keep track of your services.
3. **Enhance Security**: Introduce an authentication layer (like Authelia) to secure your applications.
4. **Expand Storage**: Incorporate a dedicated storage solution (like TrueNAS) for better data management.
5. **Scale Up**: Transition to orchestration tools (like Kubernetes) as your needs grow.

## Conclusion

Self-hosting can provide greater control over your digital services, enhance privacy, and save costs. By carefully selecting the right tools and following a structured approach, you can create a robust home server environment that meets your needs. This guide serves as a starting point, but the possibilities are vast as you explore the wealth of self-hosted applications available.
