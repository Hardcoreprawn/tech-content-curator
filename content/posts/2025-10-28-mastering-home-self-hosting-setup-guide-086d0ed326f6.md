# A Practical Guide to Running Self-Hosted Services at Home

In the age of digital privacy and control, running self-hosted services at home has become increasingly popular. This guide aims to provide a comprehensive overview of setting up a self-hosted environment, including a reference architecture for your home network, comparisons of various tools, and practical advice for a minimal viable setup.

## Reference Architecture

Below is a simple ASCII diagram of a self-hosted architecture:

```
       Internet
          |
    +-----+-----+
    |  Reverse   |
    |    Proxy   |
    +-----+-----+
          |
    +-----+-----+
    |   Auth     |
    +-----+-----+
          |
    +-----+-----+
    |   Apps     |
    +-----+-----+
          |
    +-----+-----+
    |  Storage   |
    +-----+-----+
          |
    +-----+-----+
    | Monitoring  |
    +-------------+
```

  - **Cons**: Limited features compared to full monitoring stacks.

### 6. Remote Access

- **WireGuard**
  - **Pros**: Fast, lightweight, easy to set up.
  - **Cons**: Requires some networking knowledge.

- **Tailscale**
  - **Pros**: Easy to set up, works seamlessly with NAT traversal.
  - **Cons**: Relies on a centralized service.

## Getting Started: Minimal Docker Compose Example

Below is a simple Docker Compose example to get you started with a minimal setup:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  reverse-proxy:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf

  app:
    image: your-app-image:latest
    networks:
      - internal

networks:
  internal:
```

Replace `your-app-image:latest` with the actual image of the application you want to run. You will need to create an `nginx.conf` file for your reverse proxy configuration.

## Recommended Services for Common Use-Cases

1. **Media**: **Jellyfin** - A powerful media server that allows you to stream your media library to any device.
2. **Home Automation**: **Home Assistant** - A versatile platform for home automation that integrates with numerous devices and services.
3. **Documentation**: **Outline/Wiki.js** - Great for creating and managing documentation or wikis for personal or collaborative use.

## Checklist for Your Self-Hosted Setup

- [ ] Choose a reverse proxy solution.
- [ ] Set up authentication and SSO.
- [ ] Select an orchestration method.
- [ ] Implement storage and backup solutions.
