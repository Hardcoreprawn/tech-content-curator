## Practical Evaluation Criteria
When selecting the right open-source graphics tools, consider the following criteria:
- **Functionality**: Does the tool meet your specific needs (e.g., photo editing, animation)?
- **Ease of Use**: Is the interface user-friendly, especially for beginners?
- **Community Support**: Is there an active community or documentation available for troubleshooting?
- **Performance**: How well does the tool perform with large projects or complex tasks?
- **Compatibility**: Does it support the file formats you need for your workflow?

## Getting Started

To get started with these tools, you can install them directly from their official websites or use package managers. Here’s a simple Docker Compose snippet to set up a development environment for video editing:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  kdenlive:
    image: kdenlive/kdenlive:latest
    volumes:
      - ./videos:/videos
      - ./projects:/projects
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
```

This configuration creates a container for Kdenlive, allowing you to edit videos stored in the `./videos` directory and save projects in the `./projects` directory.
