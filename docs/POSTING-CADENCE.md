# Posting Cadence & Social Summary Templates

**Goal:** Consistent weekly distribution with lightweight summaries.

## Weekly Cadence

- **Mon/Wed/Fri:** Publish new articles as they are generated.
- **Weekly Digest:** Publish a digest once per week (Sunday).
- **Social Posts:** One short summary per article + one digest post.

## Summary Templates

### Short social post (X/Bluesky/Mastodon)

```
{title}

{summary}

Read more: {url}
```

### Digest summary

```
This week’s highlights:
- {title_1} — {url_1}
- {title_2} — {url_2}
- {title_3} — {url_3}
```

## Notes

- Keep posts factual and link-first.
- Avoid meta-language about the source thread or post.
- Prefer 1–2 short sentences per item.
