# Quick Start: 3 Scientific Article Enhancements

You asked for **3 improvements to scientific articles** (like the owl flight piece). I've created **3 focused implementation guides** to replace the 9-document mess.

---

## The 3 Features

| # | Feature | Status | Cost | Guide |
|---|---------|--------|------|-------|
| 1 | **Multi-source images** | ✅ COMPLETE | $0 (free stock photos) | `FEATURE-1-STATUS.md` |
| 2 | **Academic citations** | ✅ COMPLETE | $0 (free CrossRef API) | `FEATURE-2-COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md` |
| 3 | **Concept illustrations** | ⏳ NOT STARTED | $0-0.06 (SVGs + optional AI) | `FEATURE-3-ILLUSTRATIONS.md` |

**Status**: 2 of 3 features complete ✅  
**Cost reduction achieved**: 95% (from $0.020 → $0.001 per article)  
**Result**: Better-looking, more credible scientific articles with free stock photos and academic citations

---

## How to Use These Guides

Each file has the same structure:

1. **What to Build** - Quick overview
2. **Files to Create** - Code templates (mostly pseudocode, ready to customize)
3. **Files to Modify** - Integration points in existing code
4. **API Keys** - How to get them (5-10 min per API)
5. **Tests** - What to verify
6. **Time Breakdown** - Realistic hours per task

## Recommended Implementation Order

### ✅ Feature 1: Images (COMPLETE - Oct 2025)
- Unsplash + Pexels for free photos, graceful fallback to DALL-E
- **Result**: Real stock photos instead of AI-generated images (95% cost savings)
- **Status**: 14 tests passing, integrated into pipeline, deployed

### ✅ Feature 2: Citations (COMPLETE - Oct 2025)
- CrossRef + arXiv API for academic reference lookup
- **Result**: Clickable citations linking to authoritative sources
- **Status**: 32 tests passing, 30-day cache working, deployed

### ⏳ Feature 3: Illustrations (NOT STARTED)
- SVG templates for common concepts
- Mermaid diagrams for flows
- **Impact**: Complex concepts become visual
- **See**: `FEATURE-3-ILLUSTRATIONS.md` for implementation plan

## Before You Start

### Decisions I Made (So You Don't Have To)

❌ **NOT** creating new generator route  
✅ Using conditional logic in existing `generate.py` instead (simpler, easier to test)

❌ **NOT** using deterministic rules for image queries  
✅ Using **gpt-3.5-turbo** to generate platform-specific search queries ($0.0005 per article)

❌ **NOT** requiring authentication for APIs  
✅ All APIs are free or free-tier (Wikimedia, CrossRef, Unsplash all require no auth)

✅ **Feature flags** for all components (graceful degradation if APIs fail)

✅ **Caching** for citations (30-day TTL, prevents duplicate lookups)

✅ **Budget gating** for illustrations (won't generate DALL-E unless budget allows)

## Recent Improvements (Nov 2025)

### ✅ Massive Refactoring Complete
**Status**: Successfully deployed to production (commit 99633e5)

**What Changed**:
- Monolithic files split into 7 focused packages:
  - `src/collectors/` - Content collection from multiple sources
  - `src/enrichment/` - AI-powered content analysis
  - `src/generators/` - Article generation strategies
  - `src/citations/` - Academic citation resolution
  - `src/images/` - Multi-source image selection
  - `src/deduplication/` - Story clustering and duplicate detection
  - `src/pipeline/` - Orchestration utilities

**Benefits**:
- Test coverage: 32% → 50% (243 tests)
- Easier debugging: Clear separation of concerns
- Better maintainability: Smaller, focused modules
- Production-ready: All CI/CD workflows passing

### ✅ Threading Removed for Reliability
**Status**: Deployed to production

**Why**: ThreadPoolExecutor was causing indefinite hangs when API calls timed out. Sequential processing trades ~45 minutes of speed for bulletproof reliability.

**Impact**:
- No more deadlocks during enrichment
- Easier debugging with simple control flow
- Reliable scheduled runs (pipeline runs 3x daily)
- Trade-off justified: reliability > speed for automated jobs
