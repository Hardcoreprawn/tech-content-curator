# Documentation Archive

**Historical documents from completed initiatives.**

These documents represent past work and decision-making processes. They're archived for reference but may not reflect current implementation.

---

## Why These Are Archived

- **Completion Summaries** - Historical record of what was done in each phase
- **Implementation Plans** - Planning docs from before features were built
- **Refactoring Logs** - Documentation of major code restructuring
- **Migration Guides** - One-time setup/migration procedures now complete

---

## Archived Documents

### Phase Completions
- Major milestone summaries (Phase 1-4)

- `MODULAR-REFACTOR-PYTHON314.md` - Python 3.14 migration
- `FREE-THREADING-INTEGRATION-SUMMARY.md` - Performance optimization
- `SRC-REORGANIZATION.md` - Package structure changes

### Planning Documents
- `ARTICLE-VARIETY-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` - Voice system planning
- `ARTICLE-QUALITY-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md` - Quality initiatives
- `ARTICLE-LIFECYCLE-MANAGEMENT.md` - Content management strategy

### Feature Development

## Using These Documents

**Good reasons to read archived docs:**
- Understanding *why* a decision was made
- Learning from past migration processes
- Reference for similar future work
- Historical context for current architecture

**Don't use archived docs for:**
- Current implementation details (see main docs)
- Setup instructions (use SETUP.md)
- Operational procedures (see docs/)
- Current architecture (see PROJECT-STATUS.md)

## When to Archive

Archive a document when:
- ✅ The work it describes is complete
- ✅ The information is superseded by current docs
- ✅ It's historical context, not current reference
- ✅ Keeping it in main docs adds noise

**If unsure:** Keep it in main docs. Better to have useful info accessible than perfectly organized archives.
