"""Story clustering for cross-source deduplication.

This module identifies when multiple items from different sources are about the SAME
underlying news story, even if they have different angles or perspectives.

Example:
- Item 1 (HackerNews): "Affinity Studio Goes Free"
- Item 2 (Mastodon): "Affinity Software's Freemium Shift: What Artists Need to Know"
→ Both are about Affinity's business model change, should be consolidated

This is different from post_gen_dedup.py which catches near-identical duplicates.
This catches RELATED articles about the same story before generation.

See: docs/RELATED-ARTICLES-CURATION.md
