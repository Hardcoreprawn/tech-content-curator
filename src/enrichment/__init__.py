"""Content enrichment package.

This package handles AI-powered analysis and enhancement of collected content.
It transforms raw CollectedItem objects into EnrichedItem objects with:

- Quality scores (0.0 to 1.0)
- Extracted topics and themes
- AI-generated research and context
- Entity extraction
- Source quality assessment

Components:
- scorer: Fast heuristic quality assessment
- ai_analyzer: OpenAI-powered content analysis
- orchestrator: Pipeline coordination and parallel processing
- file_io: Load/save operations for enriched content
- adaptive_scoring: Learning-based scoring improvements
- fact_check: Validation and fact-checking

Usage:
    from src.enrichment import (
        enrich_single_item,
        enrich_collected_items,
        calculate_heuristic_score,
        load_collected_items,
        save_enriched_items,
    )
    
    # Enrich a single item
    enriched = enrich_single_item(item, config)
    
    # Enrich all items in parallel
    all_enriched = enrich_collected_items(items, max_workers=5)

Design Principles:
- Fail gracefully: Return basic enrichment if AI fails
- Parallel processing with rate limiting
- Structured output for debugging
- Cost tracking for API calls
- Retry logic for transient failures

Enrichment Pipeline:
1. Initial quality check (quick filter)
2. Topic extraction (classify content)
3. Deep research (gather context)
4. Final scoring (rank for generation)
5. Adaptive learning (improve over time)
