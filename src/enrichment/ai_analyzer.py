    Analyze this social media post and give it a realistic quality score for a tech blog.

    POST CONTENT: "{item.content[:500]}"

    First, identify what this post is actually about:
    - Is it technical content (programming, systems, tools, science)?
    - Is it personal/social content (life updates, opinions, politics)?
    - Is it entitled whining or first-world problems disguised as insights?
    - Does it contain actionable insights or just commentary?
    - Is there enough technical depth to expand into an article?

    Consider these factors:
    - Technical depth and actionability
    - Broader applicability vs niche concerns
    - Whether it provides useful insights vs just complaints
    - Signal-to-noise ratio for a general tech audience

    Then score it:
    - 0.8-1.0: Major technical breakthrough or deep insight
    - 0.6-0.7: Solid technical content with practical value
    - 0.4-0.5: Some technical merit, basic but useful
    - 0.2-0.3: Minimal technical value, niche, or mostly commentary
    - 0.0-0.1: Not technical, purely personal, or no actionable value

    Be realistic but fair. Consider if the content would be useful to a meaningful portion of readers.
