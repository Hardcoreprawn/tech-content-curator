Write a comprehensive, practical guide for running self-hosted services at home.

CONTEXT FROM SOCIAL POST:
"{item.original.content}"
SOURCE URL: {item.original.url}
TOPICS: {", ".join(item.topics)}

GOALS:
- Explain a reference architecture for a home network running containers
- Compare 2-3 credible options per key category with detailed trade-offs and use-case fit
- Provide a minimal viable setup and a clear growth path
- Include an ASCII network diagram showing component relationships
- Recommend specific services for common use-cases with detailed rationale (2-3 sentences per tool)
- Include direct links to official project sites/repos for all mentioned tools
- Credit the original source at the end

CATEGORIES TO COVER (with depth):
- Reverse proxy / ingress (e.g., Traefik, Caddy, Nginx Proxy Manager)
  * Explain routing, SSL/TLS termination, and when each shines
- Authentication and SSO (e.g., Authelia, Authentik, OAuth2-Proxy)
  * Cover security model, 2FA support, and integration patterns
- Orchestration (Docker Compose vs Portainer vs K8s-in-homelab)
  * Compare complexity, scalability, and learning curve
- Storage + backups (e.g., TrueNAS, ZFS snapshots, Restic/Borg)
  * Discuss data protection, snapshots, and disaster recovery
- Monitoring + logs (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana, Loki, Uptime-Kuma)
  * Explain metrics collection, alerting, and log aggregation
- Remote access (e.g., WireGuard, Tailscale)
  * Cover security, ease of setup, and NAT traversal
- Example apps (Media: Jellyfin; Home automation: Home Assistant; Docs: Outline/Wiki.js)
  * Explain what each does and why it's popular

REQUIREMENTS:
- 1200-1500 words minimum - provide substantial detail
- Structure with clear ## headings and ### subheadings
- Include markdown links for all tool names pointing to their official sites
- Include a "Reference Architecture" ASCII diagram showing: Internet -> Reverse Proxy -> Apps, plus Auth, Storage, Monitoring
- Provide detailed "Getting Started" section with a realistic Docker Compose example (without sensitive credentials)
- Compare options with detailed pros/cons and specific use-case recommendations
- Include a "Growth Path" section explaining how to scale from simple to advanced
- Include a short "Key Takeaways" bullet list (3-5 bullets) after the introduction
- Explain non-mainstream terms and acronyms inline the first time; add a brief blockquote callout when optional using the format:
  > Background: one-sentence explanation
- Close with proper attribution: Credit the original post/author and include source URL

## Self-Hosting at Home: A Practical Starting Point

This guide outlines a simple, resilient way to run containers at home with a reverse proxy, single sign-on, storage, and monitoring.

### Minimal Reference
- Reverse proxy: Caddy or Traefik
- Auth: Authelia or Authentik
- Orchestration: Docker Compose
- Storage: TrueNAS with Restic backups
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana

Start with Docker Compose and add components gradually.
